-Led a team of three in analyzing and predicting road accident severity in Baltimore, Maryland using geospatial and machine
learning techniques.
-Utilized Kepler.gl and geospatial data to map the exact locations of accidents and identify high-risk zones.
-Employed the Accident Severity Predictor from Colab libraries to assess and classify accident impact levels, integrating weather and road conditions and speed upon impact as key factors to determine accident severity.
-Developed and compared four machine learning models (Naïve Baye’s, Random Forest, Decision Tree and Logistic Regression) and to predict accident severity under similar future conditions.Out of the four models used Random Forest perform the best with an accuracy of 93%.
-Provided data-driven insights to aid in traffic safety measures and urban planning initiatives.
