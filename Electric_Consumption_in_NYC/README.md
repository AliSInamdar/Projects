Designed and implemented a time series forecasting model using FBProphet to predict total electricity consumption for all five
boroughs of New York, both collectively and individually, over 1, 10, and 100 years.
Applied clustering techniques to identify the borough with the highest electricity consumption based on historical trends.
Conducted data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation to ensure high forecasting accuracy.
Provided data-driven insights such as energy consumption drops during the winter due the steam heating available in NYC to support energy planning and resource allocation strategies.
